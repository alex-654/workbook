### What is Git?
is distribute file system database
Git basically takes a picture of what all your files look like at that moment and stores a
reference to that snapshot. To be efficient, if files have not changed, Git doesnâ€™t store the file again,
just a link to the previous identical file it has already stored. Git thinks about its data more like a
stream of snapshots.

CVS, Subversion, Perforce, and so on is delta-based version control
