# The Software-Quality Landscape

## 20.1 Characteristics of Software Quality

External characteristics of quality are the only kind of software characteristics that
users care about.
External characteristics:

- Correctness
- Usability
- Efficiency
- Reliability
- Adaptability

Internal characteristics

- Maintainability
- Flexibility
- Portability
- Reusability
- Readability
- Testability
- Understandability

The attempt to maximize certain characteristics inevitably conflicts with the attempt to
maximize others. Finding an optimal solution from a set of competing objectives is one
activity that makes software development a true engineering discipline.

### 20.2 Techniques for Improving Software Quality

- Software-quality objectives  
  One powerful technique for improving software quality
  is setting explicit quality objectives from among the external and internal characteristics
  described in the previous section. Without explicit goals, programmers might work to
  maximize characteristics different from the ones you expect them to maximize.
- Explicit quality-assurance activity  
  One common problem in assuring quality is that
  quality is perceived as a secondary goal. Indeed, in some organizations, quick and
  dirty programming is the rule rather than the exception.
- Testing strategy
- Software-engineering guidelines  
  Guidelines should control the technical character
  of the software as itâ€™s developed. Such guidelines apply to all software development
  activities, including problem definition, requirements development, architecture, construction, and system testing.
- Informal technical reviews (pair programming)
- Formal technical reviews (CR)
- External audits
