implicit interface
https://www.hyrumslaw.com/
“The Law of Implicit Interfaces”: Given enough use, there is no such thing as a private implementation. That is, if an
interface has enough consumers, they will collectively depend on every aspect of the implementation, intentionally or
not. This effect serves to constrain changes to the implementation, which must now conform to both the explicitly
documented interface, as well as the implicit interface captured by usage. We often refer to this phenomenon as "
bug-for-bug compatibility."
