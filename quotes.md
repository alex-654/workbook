- Whenever you are tempted to type something into a print statement or a debugger expression, write it as a test
  instead.  
  _Martin Fowler_
- Be conservative in what you do, be liberal in what you accept from others.
- Code That Fits in Your Head
- Leaders are readers.
- "Code Tells You How, Comments Tell You Why"  
  _Jeff Atwood one of stackoverflow.com founders_
- The purpose of many good programming practices is to reduce the load on your gray
  cells.  
  _Completed Code(Steve McConnell)_

- Program testing can be a very effective way to show the presence of bugs, but is hopelessly inadequate for showing
  their absence  
  _The Humble Programmer by Edsger W. Dijkstra_

- Projects fail because they commit themselves to a solution before exploring alternatives. Iteration provides a way to
  learn about a product before you build it.  
  _Completed Code(Steve McConnell)_

- The way in which people work together determines whether their abilities are added to each other or subtracted from
  each other. The process the team uses determines whether one personâ€™s work supports the work of the rest of the team
  or undercuts it.  
  _Completed Code(Steve McConnell)_

- Michael Feathers says:
  To me, legacy code is simply code without tests.


- One of my favourite (of the many) things I learned from consulting with Martin Fowler is that he would often ask "
  **Compared to what?**"

      Agile helps you ship faster!
      Compared to what?

  -- Daniel Terhorst-North


- Coding is hard. Save mental energy, run your tests often

- Rob Pike:  
  Reduce cognitive load by limiting the number of choices.
